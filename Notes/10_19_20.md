Topic: Planning for live streaming of the lcls-cu injector model

## Lume-epics/model package needs
* Striptool time needs to scroll. Implement configurable max duration to keep.
* Change license to the SLAC license

## Bridge
* Hugo will check the bridge once the server + client are ready
* Client will be streamed to youtube from the firefox browser

## Modeling needs
* Redesign model to use the named input layers
* Will schedule meeting to go over changes

## Final product
* Run for x hours on youtube
* In parallel, eventually serve an interactive client with sync with live button
* Willl live in the lcls-cu-inj-live repo

## Considerations
* Inputs may not change dramatically over the window
* Are machine slots available?
* Superconducting model is currently low priority
* Once cu model is running, should be translateable
* FACET stabalizing RF now, may have some time in the next work- FACET application would be a win

## Misc
* Charge this work to the lume infrastructure code

## Future directions/discussions
* Need to play with pvs that aren't straight conversions from other pvs 
* Where will models themselves live?
